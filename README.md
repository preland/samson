# SAMson

a (very) WIP library for working with SAMv3

## scope/motivation

This library will take a "shotgun" approach to what functions are implemented. I fully anticipate having to spin off some of these functions into another library if this reaches a higher level of stability.

The motivation for this library is to create a larger set of publicly documented tools for interacting with SAM, specifically persuant to the goal of an eventual full implementation of I2P support in the Monero cryptocurrency. 

I will attempt (and admittedly likely fail) to write the library in Rust to avoid memory safety issues.

## how to use

todo l8r (or just whenever there is actual stuff to use lul)
